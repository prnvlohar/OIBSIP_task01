# Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning

Car price prediction with machine learning is a process of using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to predict the selling price of a car based on various factors such as car make, model, year, mileage, engine size, horsepower, and other relevant features.

The goal of car price prediction is to create a model that can accurately predict the selling price of a car based on these factors, which can be helpful for car dealerships, online car marketplaces, or individual car sellers to estimate the value of a car.

To create a car price prediction model, a dataset of historical car sales is used as the training data. The model learns from this data to recognize patterns and relationships between the different features and the selling price. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the selling price of a new or used car based on the input features.
